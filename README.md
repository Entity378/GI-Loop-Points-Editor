# GI-Music-Loop-Points-Editor
This is a small python script that should be able to change the loop-points of genshin songs (WIP).
Usage:
Start the program and insert the following arguments
- File path of the banks.pck file that contains the loop-points (if the script is inside the same folder just write the name of the file, for example banks1.pck)
- the ID of the Song that you want to replace (you can get it by opening the music.pck files and looking at the name of the song that you want to replace, for example that of the abyss is 1014711628)
- Duration of the song that will replace the original one in milliseconds (if it was 1 minute then it should be 60000)
